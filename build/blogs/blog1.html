        I always thought, I need a website. There was no time to create it
        between y research and other learning activities. I knew little bit of
        HTML, CSS and Python languages. So, This all website self-hosting came
        with the idea when I needed a server to store my data from my research,
        my dadâ€™s accounting database, my brothers medical notes and my
        girlfriend's photos (we all have been there right).
      </p>
      <p class="font-code text-justify mt-5 px-5">
        So. this is the time of me completed 3 years of PhD, sitting in home
        planning to write thesis with some research undergoing. Form a year or
        so, I am really into opensource and Linux platforms because of increase
        in all subscription costs and increase in paid software. I donâ€™t like
        boundaries when i use a software. Some features shouldnâ€™t be under a
        paywall. So, I converted. I made a pledge to use Linux as much as I can.
        I canâ€™t let-go of windows because of some particular software which only
        run on windows x86 platform that are related to my research.
      </p>
      <p class="font-code text-justify mt-5 px-5">
        This Linux saga helped me to be a productive researcher. I stated using
        self hosted AIâ€™s through <a href="https://ollama.com/" class="text-primary hover:opacity-50">Ollama</a>, and
        started using <a href="https://archlinux.org/" class="text-primary hover:opacity-50">Arch Linux</a> (b.t.w ðŸ˜‰)
        on my home machine. I really wanted that options to run local AIâ€™s on my
        laptop to use
        <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main" class="text-primary hover:opacity-50"> Fabric</a>
        for my research and daily reads. I could have easily
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" class="text-primary hover:opacity-50">ssh</a> into my
        machine locally to use it.
        <em>But whatâ€™s fun in that. That would be easy</em>. I wanted to access
        through internet. So finally after long consideration of a day or so. I
        went and bought a domain on my name.
      </p>
      <p class="font-code text-justify mt-5 px-5">
        I think, this will leads to endless possibilities for me to explore more
        and learn complicated things.
        <strong>These are the things which keeps me going</strong>. Blogging is
        also new to me. I have never wrote a line on a personal dairy. All new
        thingsâ€¦
